## IN PROGRESS

`source .venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python manage.py migrate`
`python manage.py runserver`

`npm run dev`

# Data prep and preprocessing (hmmmmmmm not sure if i should implement sounds hard ill look into it future thing)

- One hot encoding
- Discretization
- Standarization
- Removing unwanted examples (duplicate, irrelevant, etc.)

# Types of Models that will be added

- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- kNN
- K-Means (Medians ??)
- DCSCAN
- Ensemble clustering/methods (random forests, k-means, etc. idk yet)
- Heiarchical Clustering (is this hard idk)
- Linear Regression (All Norms + Regularizors)
- NonLinear Regression (kernel)
- Linear Classifers (hinge, logistic, SVM)
- MultiLinear Classifers (multiclass SVMs, softmax, )
- Boosted Regression Trees (XGBoost)
- PCA (use different LFM + regularizors)
- Recommendor Systems (collaborative filtering)
- MDS (different cost functions, ISOMAP, Sammon's map, etc. altough not too familiar)
- Neural Networks (Future)
- CNNs (Future)
- Transformers (funny)

# Optimization

- Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- SVD

# Feature Selection (Far future)

- Simple Regression Weight
- Search and Score
- Forward Selection

# Cool features

- Automated math to show obj fun and gradient maybe with graphs as well to plot obj fun to find min w for 2-d datasets (will be using automatic differentiation)
